ReverseSpriteSheet
==================

Get individual images back from the sprite sheet with same name from plist

Add your plist and .png file to the project and rename "PLIST_NAME" in ConversionLayer.m
also set the ouput folder name.... and then just run the app...

This will create  folder and all images with the same name from plist separately  in the Documents Dicrectory
of the Application...


current plist is "AnimBear.plist" from Raywenderlich.com

ENJOY ...... :)
